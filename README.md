# Objective 

Instacart is an online grocery platform that operates through a mobile app. While the company already sees strong sales, it is seeking deeper insights into its sales patterns through data analysis. The goal is to identify trends and suggest improved customer segmentation strategies

# Data

The dataset comprises of information on the following parameters: 

- orders
- products
- departments

The details of the data are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/psparks/instacart-market-basket-analysis)

# Tools

For this project, the following python libraries were used: 

- pandas - for data analysis
- seaborn - for visualisation

The code is available as jypyter notebooks, available under /scripts/. 

To launch the notebook, open terminal and run the command: 

- importing data: jupyter notebook importData.ipynb
- generate CrossTabs: jupyter notebook createCrossTabs.ipynb
  
[!NOTE]
You will notice notebooks for some tasks have been split into several notebooks, this is due to not having enough RAM on my CareerFoundry laptop, we were advised to split our notebooks to be able to continue with our tasks. The notebooks are clearly marked, therefore, you will be able to open one after another and continue checking the code.
